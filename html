<h1>Shantilal: An Ideal Student</h1>
<p>Shantilal possessed the ornaments of both spirituality and studies. He was a brilliant student, coming top or second in his class; even in daily attendance!
He diligently revised his daily lessons at home on the same day, often studying with Chunilal until 1.30 am. During exams, he thoroughly prepared and hence had no fear. Shantilal would chant
‘Swaminarayan’. His impeccable behaviour, quiet, disciplined and orderly nature inspired his peers.<p>
